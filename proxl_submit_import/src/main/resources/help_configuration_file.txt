The configuration file provides a way to specify some parameters

The configuration file is a Java Properties file and must adhere to that format.
(Any '\' must be doubled for escaping, so '\' would be '\\')
(Comments start with '#')

Values:

#  Same as command line option --proxl-web-app-url=
proxl.web.app.url=

#  The next property is only used when the submit program and the web app have access to the same file system.
#  When this is set properly, the locations of the files are sent to the web app, not the file contents.

#  Same as configured in the web app
proxl.upload.base.dir=

#  !!!   WARNING:   Only configure this value if 'proxl.upload.base.dir' is also configured. 

#    write.proxl.upload.dir.filename - The filename to put the upload directory in.

#   example   write.proxl.upload.dir.filename=proxlImporterDir.txt


# write.proxl.upload.dir.filename=
