Every Javascript file in this folder will be included on the page more than once (probably twice)

    1)  Included in the header JSP included
    2)  Included in the main Javascript bundle to ensure it is for sure loaded when the bundle is loaded.


This means that these needs to only happen once:
     registering of handlers on DOM elements 
     $(document).ready(...) 

Use window attached variables to track the loading of the file.
   (not ideal but necessary)
