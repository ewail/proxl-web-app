description: |
---
 Whether you're using Kojak, pLink, xQuest, Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), Crux, StavroX, or any other software pipeline, proxl supports
 data from any software pipeline using that pipeline's native scoring. There are also no restrictions on which FASTA database you use. To learn more, see
 proxl's [upload documentation](http://proxl-web-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/upload_data.html){:target="_blank"}. To
 see it in action, see [the proxl demo](https://yeastrc.org/proxl_public/go?H0DHw08DUM){:target="_blank"}.
